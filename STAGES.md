# QuantaPilotâ„¢ Development Roadmap

> _Comprehensive development stages for the autonomous project factory_

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This document outlines the complete development roadmap for QuantaPilotâ„¢, broken down into logical
stages with clear deliverables, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.

## ðŸ“Š Development Methodology

- **Iterative Development**: Each stage builds upon the previous
- **MVP-First Approach**: Core functionality before advanced features
- **Testing-Driven**: Each stage includes comprehensive testing
- **Documentation-Driven**: Complete docs before implementation
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical decision points at each stage
- **ðŸ†• Quality Gate Enforcement**: Comprehensive testing after each stage completion
- **ðŸ†• Git Workflow Integration**: Automated branch management and PR creation
- **ðŸ†• CI/CD Validation**: All GitHub checks must pass before stage progression
- **ðŸ†• Documentation Automation**: Auto-update all relevant docs after successful testing
- **ðŸ†• Stage Isolation**: Each stage gets its own branch with clean merge to main
