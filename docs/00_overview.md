# Overview

## Executive Summary

QuantaPilot™ is an autonomous project factory that transforms high-level project descriptions into complete, production-ready software solutions. By orchestrating AI-powered agents through n8n workflows, the system replicates the full software development lifecycle of a digital agency, from initial requirements gathering to final delivery.

**Current Status**: Core Infrastructure Complete (Stages 1.1-1.2) ✅

The system now features a complete microservices architecture with monitoring, security, and workflow orchestration ready for AI agent implementation in Stage 1.3.

## Vision Statement

To democratize software development by providing an autonomous, AI-driven factory that can create complete software projects with minimal human intervention, while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards and best practices.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Speed**: Projects completed in hours instead of weeks
- **Quality**: Consistent application of best practices and standards
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduced human resource requirements
- **Scalability**: Unlimited concurrent project development
- **Consistency**: Standardized processes and deliverables

## System Overview

QuantaPilot™ operates as a distributed microservices system with multiple layers:

### 1. Infrastructure Layer ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Docker Containerization**: All services containerized with health checks
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Comprehensive schema for project state management
- **Redis Cache**: Session management and caching layer
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
- **Security Framework**: Secrets management and validation

### 2. API Gateway Layer ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Central Routing**: Single entry point for all API requests
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting per service
- **Request Correlation**: Distributed tracing with correlation IDs

### 3. Microservices Layer ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Cursor Integration Service**: AI agent communication
- **GitHub Integration Service**: Repository management and webhooks
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notifications (Telegram, Email)
- **Web Dashboard**: React-based management interface
- **API Gateway**: Central routing and authentication

### 4. Orchestration Layer ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **n8n Workflows**: Pre-built project lifecycle workflows
- **HITL Decision Management**: Human-in-the-loop approval system
- **State Management**: Project lifecycle state machine
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery

### 5. AI Agent Layer 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT (Stage 1.3)
- Three specialized AI roles with distinct responsibilities
- Context-aware prompt management and execution
- Token usage optimization and cost control
- Adaptive learning from project patterns

## Key Concepts

### Autonomous Development Factory
A self-contained system that can analyze requirements, design architecture, implement code, perform testing, and deliver complete projects without continuous human oversight.

### Multi-Agent AI System
Specialized AI agents that collaborate to replicate human development team roles:
- **PR/Architect**: Strategic planning and architectural decisions
- **Senior Developer**: Implementation and code generation
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, validation, and quality assurance

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Strategic intervention points where human approval is required for critical decisions, ensuring human oversight while maintaining automation efficiency.

### Workflow Orchestration
n8n-based process management that coordinates AI agents, manages state transitions, and handles error recovery and escalation.
