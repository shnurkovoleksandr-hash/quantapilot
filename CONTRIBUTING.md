## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use GitFlow branching model:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features and enhancements
- **hotfix/**: Critical fixes for production
- **release/**: Release preparation

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(cursor): add token usage optimization
fix(github): resolve webhook signature validation
docs(api): update authentication documentation
```

### Release Process

1. **Feature Development**: Features developed in feature branches
2. **Integration**: Features merged to develop branch
3. **Release Branch**: Created from develop for release preparation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on release branch
5. **Release**: Merge to main and tag with version
6. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Husky**: Git hooks for quality checks

**Configuration files:**

- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration
- `package.json`: lint-staged configuration

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **Service Independence**: Each service should be independently deployable
2. **API First**: Design APIs before implementation
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Security**: Security considerations in all code
5. **Performance**: Consider performance implications
6. **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting

### Database Guidelines

1. **Migrations**: All schema changes via migrations
2. **Indexing**: Proper indexing for performance
3. **Constraints**: Use database constraints for data integrity
4. **Transactions**: Use transactions for multi-step operations

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/      # Test data and mocks
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test performance requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should describe what is being tested
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include edge cases and error conditions

**Example:**

```javascript
describe('Project Creation', () => {
  it('should create project when valid repository URL provided', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const validRepoUrl = 'https://github.com/user/repo';
    const mockGithubService = jest.mock('./github-service');

    // Act
    const result = await projectService.create(validRepoUrl);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('project_id');
    expect(result.status).toBe('initializing');
  });
});
```

## Documentation
